# Caribbean Event Society — Project Context

A curated platform for event and creative professionals in Trinidad & Tobago. Phase 1 delivers a public-facing website, a member directory with an application-to-approval flow, and an admin curation layer.

Built by YoucoLabs (Faye Hayes) for client JaaEL Shebioba.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Auth — Custom JWT
- No Clerk, no NextAuth. Tokens issued from our own DB.
- **Access token**: short-lived (15 min), stored in memory (Zustand store). Never in localStorage.
- **Refresh token**: stored in an httpOnly cookie.
- `server/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` verifies JWT on protected routes.
- `client/api/axios.ts` attaches the bearer token on every request and silently refreshes on 401 before retrying.

### MVC on the Backend
- `app/api/**/route.ts` files are thin — they call a controller and return the response.
- Controllers parse the request and delegate to a service.
- Services contain business logic and call models.
- Models contain Prisma queries only — no business logic.

### Types
- All types live in `src/server/types/`, one file per resource.
- Imported by both server and client code via the `@/server/types/*` alias.

### Member Application Flow
- Registration creates a `User` + `Profile` with `status: 'pending'`.
- Admin reviews pending profiles and sets `status: 'approved' | 'rejected'`.
- Directory only shows `status: 'approved'` profiles. Admins can also toggle `status: 'hidden'`.
- No separate applications table — `profile.status` is the source of truth.

### Directory Search (Phase 1)
- Postgres `ilike` + GIN index on `name` and `bio`.
- Filter by `category` and `location` via query params on `GET /api/profiles`.

## Phase 1 Milestones

1. **Project Kickoff & Technical Setup** ← current
2. **Public-Facing Website** — home, about, events, event detail, contact
3. **Directory & Member Application Flow** — auth, profiles, search/filter
4. **Admin Curation Layer** — review queue, approve/reject, visibility toggle
5. **QA, Testing & Launch**
6. **Final Acceptance**

### Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- Payment processing / Stripe
- Membership tiers or gated content
- Member dashboards
- Visual design (provided by client — JaaEL Shebioba)
- Copywriting (provided by client)
